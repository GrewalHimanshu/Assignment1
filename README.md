[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/petercunha/Pad.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/petercunha/Pad)

Pad is an extremely lightweight, low-latency, collaborative notepad built with [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)!

Requirements
------------

  * Node 6.x or later
  * Required Node packages
  * Open port, if you want a public site

As long as you have Node 6 installed, you can just `git clone` and `npm install` and you'll be ready to roll!
